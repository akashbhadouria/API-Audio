# Synopsis -

This project is a life changing mini prototype for the visually impaired and blind people who have had good or decent vision in the past.
This will not only help the users who are facing challenges in using daily life apps, but also were not able to use Internet to it's full power! because of unfortunate physical disablities.

## Challenge - 

#### People with impaired or no vision are not able to do E-commerce shopping via apps.

____________________

## Solution - 

#### Whenever a user will hover over any product it will not only tell the Name,details of it, but also the price which it costs to own it.

____________________

## Future Improvements - 

#### 1. Assist the users in doing complete shopping without even using any device accept their phones. So no use of keyboard/mouse nothing.Just pure way to empower the users via their voice.

#### 2. Integrate this feature with all the applications which a user is using or may want to use.

### Note -

#### Not added additional CSS effects because, I was considering the user base of people who have impaired or no vision at all. So no fancy effects as of now. But can be added if required.
